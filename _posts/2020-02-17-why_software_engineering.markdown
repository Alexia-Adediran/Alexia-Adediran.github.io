I chose Software engineering because technology is at a constant rise. I find that being able to take part in the creation and development of software is a huge part of technolgy and how the population interacts with it. The amount of careers and oppurtunities in tech are endless and the idea that I can be apart of the movement is fascinating to me. I love how intriguing and rewarding it is when you complete a code and its runs properly and is fully functional it is a truly rewarding feeling. With the rise in technology, my willingness to learn and my overall joy for coding I feel like I can have a longterm career in Software Engineering and technology as a whole.
